# What information is required to create a new product? 
Please see the admin-workflows to see how our user Marcus would create a new product.

# How does the database change?
The database schema/structure remains unchanged when a new product is introduced.
New rows are inserted for almost every table we have though because we need to insert into the `products`, `categories`, and `parts` tables.
